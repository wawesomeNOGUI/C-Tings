-To compile C++ Programs use:
 "g++ <the .cpp filename> -o <new .exe filename you want> -l<.dll libraries you want to use>"

-e.g. To compile a OpenGL program using the GLFW library use:

g++ openGLTest.cpp -o openGLTest.exe -lglfw3dll -lopengl32

glfw3.dll is the dynamic linked library of GLFW
opengl32 is the dynamic linked library of OpenGL that GLFW references??

Not sure about how this all works but it does???


-To compile pixelRead program, or any using "GetPixel" function use:

compile with g++ pixelRead.cpp -o <newname> -lGdi32  (a library)



Check out this link if need additional help (first answer is pretty good, 
you don't have to do the first "g++ -c main.cpp" command, can do it the way I say above):
